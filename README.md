### Elevator pitch

We all love the fun and random dice game **Qwixx**! It's fun, with just the perfect mixture of skill and luck that no two games are alike! The problem? Finding people to play with. This will solve that, by making a version of the game playable online. That way we're not limited to just our friends in person, but instead we can play with each other accross town, or even the country!
